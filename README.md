### TheRuntingMuumuu
Hi, My name is TheRuntingMuumuu. I am a programmer, and gamer.
Currently I know Html, CSS, and I can understand javascipt. I am decent with Python, but I still have to improve. I am also learning Java.

My main issues are with the formatting and big ideas of programming rather than the syntax (take my variable naming as an example... And my comments [or lack of comments])

I am really pretty bad at programming, but I hope to get better
